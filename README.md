# Realtime E-Consult Quality Monitoring
This project is about getting realtime feedback of a client while consulting virtually using video conference. It uses realtime emotion detection to observe and monitor the behavior of a person in a video by classifying them into seven classes: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Disgust, Fear and Neutral.

## Application
This can be easily integrated with any video calling application to monitor the facial expression of the customer/client in realtime. The code can also be modified to capture the expressions of multiple people participating in video conference to monitor the impact of a presentation or talk.
